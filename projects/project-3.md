I developed the website for Ka’ala Systems Technology (KST). It acts as a majority of KST’s online presence and as a way for KST to meet some of its requirements as a government contractor. The website contains general information of the company such as contact information and the contracts that they have won. There is also a news section that contains articles about events within KST. A job posting page is also available that contains information on jobs that are available and how to apply for them. The website also serves as a location for various training programs that workers may need to use.

I first learned about web design from the previous web developer for them. I only met with him once but he showed me the basics of HTML coding. I then went online and watched videos and read articles to learn CSS and get a better understanding of HTML. I went on to design the entire website from scratch using CSS, HTML and minor JavaScript.

For the legal matters I created my own company called AKM Technologies. In legal terms, this company is contracted by KST.
