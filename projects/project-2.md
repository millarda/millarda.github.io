StudyBoss is an iOS application that I helped design with my teammate Brandon Wong. The purpose of StudyBoss is to act as a flashcard app with a built in notification feature.

With StudyBoss, a user can create a deck of cards each with a front and back. A user can then browse the cards in a deck the way they would with actual flash cards. They can then quiz themselves by flipping the cards as they browse the cards. The order the cards are presented in is random to help make it easier for one to quiz themselves.StudyBoss' notification settings allowed the user to pick a time and then receive periodical notifications from that point onward.

StudyBoss was coded with swift in the Xcode IDE. This required the learning of a type of language that I was unfamiliar with. Xcode's storyboard layout for coding gave me a look at a different way to develop software. This is because the storyboard allows the developer to design what the app does using a GUI with modules and relationships.

StudyBoss was not published to the AppStore but is open source.
