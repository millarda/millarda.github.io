<h2>Making Things Easier with UI Frameworks</h2>
UI Frameworks are a tool that can be used to provide a less manual experience in coding. Semantic UI is an example which is used to support webpages in HTML and CSS. I find Semantic to be extremely useful as it takes care of some of the tedious parts of coding. It allows me to focus more on design and scripting instead of working on multitudes of visual aspects. I have built a website already using only CSS and HTML and have felt the struggle of manually defining tons of different values so that they appear correct. This includes having to ensure that the site appears correct with different page widths
