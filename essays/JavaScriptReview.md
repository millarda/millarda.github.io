<h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript is a language that I have previously only had light knowledge of. I had only really learned enough of it to be able to modify small pieces of JavaScript code (maybe 40 lines). In my new class ICS 314 we have rapidly begun learning and practicing how to use the language effectively. We have already done a large number of exercises from <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> that have given me a more thorough understanding of basic JavaScript. This already completes one of my goals for this course, but I am excited to get a deeper understanding of the language.

<h2>Working with JavaScript</h2>
I enjoy JavaScript’s lax regulations on syntax; however, this does bring some concern with code possibly not acting as expected. What I mean is that JavaScript is far more likely to execute incorrect code than a more rigorous language like C which would not compile in the first place. I do consider the ease of JavaScript to make it more approachable as well as useful for quickly producing work. I would much rather use a more rigid language for the situation when code performing unexpectedly could lead to catastrophic results.

<h2>Work Outs of the Day</h2>
In this ICS 314 class there is a unique method of teaching that involves periodical Work Outs of the Day (WOD). These are basically an exercise on certain material that is timed and repeatable. So far there have been three types of WODs: individual, group and graded. I find the individual WODs to be an excellent self-evaluation of how capable one is in performing a certain task. I enjoy the group WODs likely because I just enjoy group work in general. The graded WODs are individual, not repeatable and are pass-fail. In order to pass, one must complete the task in the required time and have the code meet all requirements. I have only experienced one graded WOD and I found it to be stressful due to the time limit. This is because I don’t consider myself one who can always react quickly to something in the best manner. I have no opposition to this learning style since these WODs should help me overcome this weakness.
